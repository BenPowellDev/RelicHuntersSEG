# RelicHuntersSEG
This was a part of my group coursework for Software Engineering for Games. I took on the role of the Core Developer. I was in charge on creating all of the UI and Menu systems, as well as acting as the Scrum Master, in order to ensure the final application runs smoothly.

# Group
Our Group consisted of these 5 roles:

Core Developer (Menu, Level and GameStates, UI and Final Migration)

Enemy & Pickup Developer (Enemy Creation and Logic) x2

Level Developer (Tilemap Creation, and World Collisions)

Player Developer (Player Movement, Interaction and Weapons)
