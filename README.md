# RelicHuntersSEG
This was a part of my group coursework for Software Engineering for Games. I took on the role of the Core Developer. I was in charge on creating all of the UI and Menu systems, as well as merging all of the other group members work together, in order to create the final application run smoothly.

Core Developer (Menu, Level and GameStates, UI and Final Migration)
